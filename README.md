## General Info
In this notebook I attempt to predict whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not.  
This was done as part of a kaggle challenge which evaluated based on F1 score.  
The final model F1 score that was received was around 0.774 as displayed in the above image.
The kaggle challenge is linked [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview/description)
